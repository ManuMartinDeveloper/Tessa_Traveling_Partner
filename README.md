## Project: Tessa - Travel Booking Assistant ✈️

This project is a **conversational travel agent** built in Python. It uses AI to understand user requests for flights and hotels and interacts with the Amadeus API to find real-time information. The user interacts with it through a web interface built with Streamlit.

---

### Core Components:

1.  **`app.py` - The User Interface**
    * This file creates the web application using **Streamlit**.
    * It provides a simple chat interface where the user can type their travel queries (like "Find flights from BLR to COK tomorrow").
    * It takes the user's input and sends it to the AI agent (`llm_graph.py`) to get a response.
    * Finally, it displays the agent's response back to the user.

2.  **`llm_graph.py` - The AI Agent Brain**
    * This is the central logic hub, using **LangGraph** to manage the conversation flow.
    * It employs a **two-LLM (worker/supervisor) architecture**:
        * **Worker LLM**: Its job is to understand the user's request and decide which tool (like flight search or hotel search) needs to be called. It uses the available tools defined in `tools.py`.
        * **Supervisor LLM**: Takes the results from the tools (after the worker calls them) and the conversation history, then generates a final, user-friendly response. It summarizes the data clearly (e.g., listing top flight options).
    * It manages the **state** of the conversation (the history of messages).
    * It defines the **workflow**: Entry point -> Agent decides -> Call Tool (if needed) -> Summarize -> End.

3.  **`amadeus_api_client.py` - Amadeus API Interaction**
    * This file contains the `AmadeusAPI` class, which handles communication with the Amadeus developer APIs.
    * It manages **authentication** using API keys (loaded from environment variables using `dotenv`).
    * It provides specific methods to:
        * `find_one_way_flights`: Search for flight offers based on origin, destination, date, passengers, etc..
        * `find_hotels_in_city`: Search for hotels using a city code.
        * `find_hotels_by_area`: Search for hotels near a specific latitude/longitude point within a radius.

4.  **`tools.py` - Agent's Capabilities**
    * This file defines the specific **functions (tools)** that the Worker LLM can use.
    * These tools act as bridges between the AI and external services or data:
        * `get_current_date`: Gets today's date to help with relative date queries ("tomorrow", "next week").
        * `search_flights`: Calls the `find_one_way_flights` method in `amadeus_api_client.py` based on structured input (origin, destination, date, etc.). Uses `FlightSearchInput` schema for validation.
        * `Google Hotels_by_city`: Calls `find_hotels_in_city`. Uses `HotelCitySearchInput` schema.
        * `Google Hotels_by_area`: Calls `find_hotels_by_area`. It can also use `_get_geocoordinates` (using `geopy`) to convert a place name (like "Eiffel Tower") into latitude/longitude if needed. Uses `HotelAreaSearchInput` schema.
    * It uses Pydantic (`BaseModel`, `Field`) to define expected inputs for the tools, ensuring the AI provides data in the correct format.

### Supporting Files:

* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python libraries needed to run the project (e.g., `streamlit`, `langchain`, `langgraph`, `amadeus`, `geopy`).
* **`learning.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook likely used for testing the Amadeus API client and the defined tools during development.
* **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files that should not be tracked by Git (like the `.env` file containing API keys).
* **`__pycache__`**: Contains compiled Python bytecode files, automatically generated by Python to speed up execution. Not directly part of the project logic.

### How it Works (Simplified Flow):

1.  User enters a query in the Streamlit app (`app.py`).
2.  The app sends the query to the LangGraph agent (`llm_graph.py`).
3.  The Worker LLM in the agent analyzes the query and decides to call a tool (e.g., `search_flights` from `tools.py`).
4.  The `search_flights` tool calls the appropriate method (e.g., `find_one_way_flights`) in `amadeus_api_client.py`.
5.  `amadeus_api_client.py` communicates with the Amadeus API and gets flight data.
6.  The data is returned through the tool back to the agent graph.
7.  The Supervisor LLM takes the tool results and conversation history, formats a nice answer.
8.  The agent sends the final response back to `app.py`.
9.  Streamlit displays the response to the user.
